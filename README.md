[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/53c2eff6-5a87-4112-83d6-ada7bc0e2efc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/modest-euler-f2dd2f/deploys)

A tiny page built with [11ty](https://11ty.dev/). ([See it in action.](https://shivjm.name/))

Install dependencies: <kbd>npm install</kbd><br>
Run development server: <kbd>npm start</kbd><br>
Build for production (placing output under _site): <kbd>npx eleventy</kbd>

Note: Because the CSS is embedded in the HTML, to see the effects of changing styles while running the development server, you must force index.pug to be re-processed, e.g. by forcing a save.
