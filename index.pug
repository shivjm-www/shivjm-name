      p Hello. My legal name is #[q.full Shiv Jha Mathur]:
      +annotated-name("Shiv", "Jha Mathur")
      p Outside of legal documents, I add a hyphen to indicate that #[q Jha] and #[q Mathur] must be kept together, making it #[q.full Shiv Jha-Mathur]:
      +annotated-name("Shiv", "Jha-Mathur")
      p In other words, I have a two-part last name and a single first name. I do not have a middle name or two first names. So, for example, #[strong my name is not]:
      ul.incorrect
        for name in names.incorrect
          li= name
      p I often abbreviate it as #[q Shiv J.M.] (as in the #[abbr URL] of this page).
